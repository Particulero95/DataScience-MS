    "# Exercise: Train and Run Your First Model\n",
    "\n",
    "We've learned that models are computer code that processes information to make a prediction or a decision. Here, we'll train a model to guess a comfortable boot size for a dog, based on the size of the harness that fits them.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the examples below, there is no need to edit any code. Try to read it, understand it, then press the run button to run it. As always with these notebooks, it is vitally important that these code blocks are run in the correct order, and nothing is missed.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Note**: If you've never used the Jupyter Notebooks environment before, there are a few things you should be aware of:\n",
    "> \n",
    "> - Notebooks are made up of *cells*. Some cells (like this one) contain *markdown* text, while others (like the one beneath this one) contain code.\n",
    "> - You can run each code cell by using the **&#9658; Run** button. the **&#9658; Run** button will show up when you hover over the cell.\n",
    "> - The output from each code cell will be displayed immediately below the cell.\n",
    "> - Even though the code cells can be run individually, some variables used in the code are global to the notebook. That means that you should run all of the code cells <u>**in order**</u>. There may be dependencies between code cells, so if you skip a cell, subsequent cells might not run correctly.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Preparing data\n",
    "\n",
    "The first thing we do with a model is load data. We'll cover this in more detail in a later exercise. For now, we'll just write our data directly in our code. Review and run the following code to get started:\n"

    "Para que un equipo pueda comprender nuestro objetivo, debemos proporcionárselo como un fragmento de código denominado función objetivo (también conocido como función de costo). Las funciones objetivo evalúan si el modelo es eficaz (es decir, si calcula la talla correcta de las botas) o no (es decir, si se equivoca a la hora de calcular la talla de las botas). Trataremos las funciones objetivo en profundidad en el material de aprendizaje posterior.\n",

    "Los datos también se refieren a la información que la función objetivo podría necesitar. Por ejemplo, si nuestra función objetivo nos indica si el modelo ha predicho la talla correcta de las botas, necesitará saber cuál es la talla correcta de las botas. Este es el motivo por el que, en el ejercicio anterior, proporcionamos tanto las tallas de los arneses como las respuestas correctas al código de entrenamiento.\n",

    "\n",
    "Es importante tener en cuenta que el objetivo, los datos y el optimizador son simplemente un medio para entrenar el modelo. No son necesarios una vez completado el entrenamiento. También es importante recordar que el entrenamiento solo cambia los valores de parámetro dentro del modelo, es decir, no cambia el tipo de modelo que se usa."
